# raylibstarter

[![CMakeBuilds](https://github.com/chfhhd/raylibstarter/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chfhhd/raylibstarter/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

This raylib C++ project template for CMake is a modified fork of the raylibstarter template by Christoph Hahn (@chfhhd) [1], based on the window scale letterbox example [2] contributed by Anata (@anatagawa) and reviewed by Ramon Santamaria (@raysan5) and the CMakeLists.txt 
example provided in the Raylib source code [3].

The fork removes almost all premade classes to provide a cleaner start.
